Placido-Shop is an open-source software that
required many hours of work on my own funds.

You can tell me about the security problems you encounter without fear,
you will be welcome.

For the moment I do not have the means to reward with money the researchers
who would find security flaws in the application, but that may come.

Thanks for your help, best regards.

RaphaÃ«l Castello - Developer of Placido-Shop.
